    "In this example, we will imagine that the potato chip factory SÃ¸rlandschips AS has started up three facilities for producing their products `(A, D, J)`. These factories can send bags of potato chips to three different customers `(E, G, H)`. Similarly to the Transportation Problem, the factories have a maximum production capacity and the customers have a limited demand. But in this case, there are a lot of differnt route alternatives between each pair of factory and customer. In this example, we want to ensure that all customer demands are met (total of 2700 units) at a minimum cost, where the production capacity is actually larger than the demand (total of 3000 units)."

It should be able to receive units from all nodes that it is directly connected to, meaning the pairs `((A,B), (C,B), (E,B), (H,B))`. Similarly, it should also be possible to send units to these neighbouring nodes, meaning the pairs `((B,A),(B,C),(B,E),(B,H))`.

One could easily make the mistake of assuming that the constraint for these nodes would be that they can only deliver out the same ampunt of units that they can produce. However, if e.g. factory `D` want to send units to node `B` _through_ node `A`, this will not be possible under the suggested constraint, as the number of units exiting node `A`would the nbe greater than the capacity it is able to produce by itself. Instead, we must limit the outgoing stream of units to the sum of the source nodes capacity AND the all other units _entering_ the node.
