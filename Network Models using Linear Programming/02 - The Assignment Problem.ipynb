Luckily, the hospital have more than enough ambulances, so the problem is only a matter of figuring out which ambulance to send where. The ambulances are all located at different locations, so the distance between each ambulance and each patient is different. Based on the GPS-position of the ambulances and the patients, we get an estimate of the time it would take any ambulance to drive to any patient in the following table:"

    "#  Final notes:\n",
    "In this example, the number of ambulances matched the number of patients. This might not be the case in a real life scenario, where two other cases might occure:\n",
    "1. If you have more ambulances than pasients, change the $=$-constraint to a $\\leq$-constraint in the section where we enforced that _\"any ambulance {$a$} can only visit one patient\"_. This will enable some ambulances to visit zero patients.\n",
    "2. If you have more pasients than ambulances, change the $=$-constraint to a $\\leq$-constraint in the section where we enforced that _\"any patient {$p$} can only be visited by one ambulance\"_. This is a grimmer solution, though, as it allows the ambulances to not visit the patients that would take too long to visit. Nonetheless, in situations where there are more patients than the doctors are able to treat, these kinds of decisions sometimes have to be made. However, for further work on this case, a better solution might be to factor in severity in the objective function. This way, the optimization algorithm would consider e.g. a weighted sum between the \"chance of survival\" and the time it would take an ambulance to get there."
